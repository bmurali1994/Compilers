# Compilers

Compiler for a C - kind of language    

Developed different aspects of a compiler for a c-like language. The compiler uses a Lexical Analyzer and LL1 Parser and        processes the input code generating a valid 3 address code for the input program. The system was developed in CPP using         utilities like Bison and Flex. 

The code does not have proper comments. Feel free to get back to me for any explanation.
